      "description": "This API call allows an agent to monitor a call that is active for another agent using their active agent login/session. The monitoring agent's \"station phone number\" (or phone number associated with the \"station ID\") will be used to contact the monitoring agent, and connect them with one-way-audio to the call's conversation stream. When monitoring, the monitoring agent can only hear the active agent and patron, but cannot speak to either of them.<br/>The monitoring agent must be configured as a \"supervisor\" of the active agent in the Central website. Attempting to monitor another agent for whom you are not a supervisor will result in an error status code being returned.<br/>The monitoring session will remain active as long as the active agent's agent leg is connected. If the active agent's station is disconnected or hangs up, the monitoring session is discontinued.<br/>There are events that are generated when you are successfully monitoring another agent.<div class='tabs_wrapper' data-path='Agent_supervisor_postSessionIDMonitor.html'></div>",
